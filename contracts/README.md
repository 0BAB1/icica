# Icica contracts

This directory is the chain-side stuff. It's a hardhat projet used to deploy this contract on-chain.

The icica meme is a very simple project relying on a simple ECR721 contract.

Once you generate your icica image meme, it is uploaded via frontend [https://nft.storage/], the IPFS data is then tied to the NFT.

Please create a .env file in which you will give the daa this project need (like an account for deplying the contract).
